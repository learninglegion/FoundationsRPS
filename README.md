# FoundationsRPS
The Rock, Paper, Scissors assignment from the Foundations section of The Odin Project.

This is the first real programming assignment in The Odin Project, though it's designed/specced
to be run in the console, so it still has some wiggle room on the word 'real'.

I'm using this readme to jot down my pseudocode and other thoughts.

1  OUTPUT Initialize - Inform user how the game works
2  INPUT Hit a key to indicate understanding (and to function as a game beginning)
3  INPUT Ask user to choose Rock Paper or Scissors (1, 2, or 3) and record choice
4  OPTIONAL - create countdown to mimic RL gameplay. Maybe ask for countdown at step 2
5  OUTPUT Computer chooses Rock Paper or Scissors
6  LOGIC Choices compared
7  OUTPUT Assign point
8  OUTPUT Track points
9  OUTPUT Declare winner if winning point count reached
10  INPUT Ask to play again


Othet things that might be nice:
Autoplay, cpu vs cpu
HAve option to choose one weapon for hundreds or thousands of iterations to view RNG
Turn it into RPSLizard Spock
If logic that repeats CPU shoot (e.g. at 0) show how many times 0 was hit before hitting 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9)

More to come, have to go to work :(
